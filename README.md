Twitter_extension
=================

a extension to communicate with twitter api and post status updates  


1. to execute this code one has to use a local server like wamp ..and place the files in a folder call twitter.

2. run my.php ..this should give u an authorization page to communicate with twitter api

3. provide with relevent information a tweet "Yea this is indeed a fun extension" should be on your wall..

4.This tweet is hard coded in twitter_oauth.php 

TO DO : My next work involves passing the statement from a textbox popup.html to the pass the tweet to twitter_oauth.php and tweet
it dynamically
