Twitter_extension
=================

a extension to communicate with twitter api and post status updates  


Firstly to execute this code one has to use a local server like wamp ..and place the files in a folder call twitter.
Next step would be to run my.php ..
this should give u an authorization page to communicate with twitter api and when supplied with relevent information a
tweet "YEA this is indeed a fun extension" should be on your wall..
This tweet is hard coded in twitter_oauth.php 

My next work involves passing the statement from a textbox popup.html to the pass the tweet to twitter_oauth.php and tweet
it dynamically
